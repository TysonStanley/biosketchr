# Personal Statement {-}

Your statement about your qualifications for the proposal goes here. Include up-to-four citations related to the statement (either using the `make_numbered_citations()` function as shown below with the appropriate keys from the `.bib` file or manually entered). This can often include any previous products from collaborations between the research team that is relevant to the current proposal. Ultimately, this is a space to show that you are competent capable of completing the proposed project. Feel free to erase all of this filler text.
