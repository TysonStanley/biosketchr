The goal of `biosketchr` is to make two aspects of creating a Biosketch better:

1. Formatting of the biosketch is automatically done for you
2. The citations are automatically formatted and inserted in the document

## Installation

You can install `biosketchr` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tysonstanley/biosketchr")
```

## LaTeX

The template was created by Paul M. Magwene and can be found at: [github.com/pmagwene/latex-nihbiosketch](https://github.com/pmagwene/latex-nihbiosketch).

## Example

To start, you'll want to select the appropriate template (currently only the NIH one) from the `biosketchr` package. This will create a folder with whatever name you choose that contains an `Rmd` file, the appropriate `.cls` file, and a `.bib` file.

<img src="man/figures/select_template.png" align="center" width="50%" height="50%"/>

The `.Rmd` file will open automatically showing you this template.

<img src="man/figures/skeleton_rmd.png" align="center" width="50%" height="50%"/>

This is where you'll do all the editing, writing your statement, fill in education, etc. You'll also want to edit the `yourbibfile.bib` file with your citations that you want to include in the biosketch.

When you `knit` this, it will produce a PDF file in the same folder that is formatted like the appropriate biosketch. This PDF will look something like the following:

<img src="man/figures/pdf_output_example.png" align="center" width="50%" height="50%"/>

Enjoy biosketching with RMarkdown!


## Note

The package is still undergoing some development and we would love feedback on any aspect that doesn't work as expected. 

We also want to thank the [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package for showing how to create RMarkdown templates such as in `biosketchr`.
