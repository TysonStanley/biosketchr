# `biosketchr` `v`r packageVersion("biosketchr")`` <img src="inst/biosketchr_hex.png" align="right" width="30%" height="30%"/>



The goal of `biosketchr` is to make two aspects of creating a Biosketch better:

1. Formatting of the biosketch is automatically done for you
2. The citations are automatically formatted and inserted in the document

## Installation

You can install `biosketchr` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tysonstanley/biosketchr")
```

## LaTeX

The template was created by Paul M. Magwene and can be found at: [github.com/pmagwene/latex-nihbiosketch](https://github.com/pmagwene/latex-nihbiosketch).

## Example


This will be added soon...


## Note

The package is still undergoing some development and we would love feedback on any aspect that doesn't work as expected. 

We also want to thank the [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package for showing how to create RMarkdown templates such as in `biosketchr`.
